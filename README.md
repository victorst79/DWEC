# Unit 1

## Worksheet#1

- 4- Using two variables, it operates and displays the value of both
("The value of the first variable is ..."), and the result of the main operations
mathematics ("The sum is: ....").

## Worksheet#2

- 1- The Age Calculator

    - Store the curret year in a variable.
    - Store their birth year in a variable.
    - Calculate their 2 possible ages based on the stored values.
    - Output them to the screen like so: "They are either NN or NN", substituting the values.

- 3- The Geometrizer

    - Store a radius into a variable.
    - Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
    - Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".


- 4- The Temperature Converter

    - Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
    - Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".
    - Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
    - Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."

## Worksheet#3

- 1- The Fortune Teller

    - Write a function named `tellFortune` that:
        - Takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
        - Outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
    - Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

- 2- The Age Calculator

    - Write a function named `calculateAge` that:
        - Takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
        - Calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
        - Outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
    - Call the function three times with different sets of values.
    - Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.

- 3- The Lifetime Supply Calculator

    - Write a function named `calculateSupply` that:
        - Takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
        - Calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
        - Outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
    - Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
    - Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.

- 4- The Geometrizer

 - Create a function called `calcCircumfrence`:

    - Pass the radius to the function.
    - Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".

- Create a function called `calcArea`:

    - Pass the radius to the function.
    - Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

- 5- The Temperature Converter

- Create a function called `celsiusToFahrenheit`:

    - Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
    - Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".

- Create a function called `fahrenheitToCelsius`:

    - Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
    - Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."

## Worksheet#4
